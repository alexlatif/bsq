◦ All lines must have the same length.
◦ There’s at least one line of at least one box.
◦ At each end of line, there’s a line break.
◦ The characters on the map can only be those introduced in the first line.

The executable must be called bsq and be present in the main directory

When your program receives more than one map in argument, each solution or error
must be followed by a line break.



//TEST

test - must handle 1 to n files as parameters

test - if all the elements are obstacles - map error



//BACKLOG

clean compile after run and logs

- NORM 
get_board_matrix params

if all elements are empty - result = square
