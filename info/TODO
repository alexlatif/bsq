//BACKLOG

- validate at incoming file before setting 

- unsigned ints

- NORM

find_swipe has 5 arguments, array from x, y

clean compile after run and logs

if all the elements are obstacles, then show - map error? no free space? in snap

if all elements are empty - result = square 

- massive map


//bek
- optimize
- borders
- binary
- search pos
- FREE
